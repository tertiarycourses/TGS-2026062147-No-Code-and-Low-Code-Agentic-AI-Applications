## Lab Activities

**Activity 1 — Flyer with QR Code** · Form Trigger → Gmail + QR code on an event flyer.
![Activity 1](labs/activity1-flyer-form/Activity1-Flyer-Form.png)

**Activity 2 — Capture Submissions in a Data Table** · Every form submission saved to an n8n Data Table alongside the email.
![Activity 2](labs/activity2-data-table/Activity2-Data-Table.png)

**Activity 3 — Conditional Response** · IF-node routing: "Yes" saves to Data Table (3a) / Google Sheets (3b), "No" sends a thank-you email.
![Activity 3](labs/activity3-conditional/Activity3a-Conditional-Data-Table.png)

**Activity 4 — Telegram AI Agent** · Telegram-triggered AI agent with memory (4a) + a Data Table tool for HR lookups (4b).
![Activity 4](labs/activity4-telegram-agent/Activity4a-Telegram-Agent.png)

**Activity 5 — RAG Telegram Agent** · Agent routes between a Vector Store knowledge base and a Data Table — two sources, one bot.
![Activity 5](labs/activity5-rag/Activity5-RAG-Telegram.png)

**Activity 6 — Website Chatbot via Webhook** · Investment Advisor site with an enquiry form and floating AI chatbot, both wired to one n8n webhook.

## About

This repository contains the complete, working lab materials for the **WSQ Agentic AI Automation with n8n** course (**TGS-2023035977**) by Tertiary Courses / Tertiary Infotech. Each activity is a self-contained, importable [n8n](https://n8n.io) workflow — several paired with a polished HTML front end — that builds progressively from basic automation to a full **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** agent.

### What you'll learn

|---|----------|----------|
| **1** | **Flyer with QR Code** | Form Trigger → Gmail, expressions, QR-code generation |
| **2** | **Capture Data in a Data Table** | n8n Data Tables, storing submissions |
| **3a / 3b** | **Conditional Response** | IF-node branching → Data Table (3a) / Google Sheets persistence (3b) |
| **4a / 4b** | **Telegram AI Agent** | Telegram Trigger, AI Agent + `gpt-4.1-mini`, memory, Data Table tool |
| **5** | **RAG Telegram Agent** | Tokenization, embeddings, vector store, routing between two knowledge sources |
| **6** | **Website Chatbot (Investment Advisor)** | Webhook trigger, CORS, `Respond to Webhook`, branded front end |
| **7** | **Finance API → Telegram (Day Trader)** | HTTP Request, Twelve Data + NewsAPI, multi-timeframe analysis |
| **8a / 8b** | **Security & Guardrails** | Human-in-the-loop approval, pre/post guardrails around the agent |
| **Capstone** | **Mini Capstone** | End-to-end build (Issue Reporting: form + image → Postgres) |

> 📖 **Full walkthrough:** see **[LEARNER-GUIDE.md](LEARNER-GUIDE.md)** for detailed, click-by-click instructions (with workflow diagrams) for every activity, plus a troubleshooting cheat-sheet and glossary. Slides, the Learner Guide and the Lesson Plan are in [`courseware/`](courseware/).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- An [**n8n**](https://n8n.io) account (Cloud or self-hosted)
- An [**OpenAI API key**](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
- A [**Tavily API key**](https://tavily.com) (web-search tool)
- A **Gmail** account (for Activity 1 email)
- A modern browser (for the Activity 3, 4 & 5 web pages)
- *(Optional, for the Issue Reporting mini-capstone)* a **Postgres** database (e.g. [Supabase](https://supabase.com))

### 1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tertiarycourses/TGS-2023035977-Agentic-AI-Automation-with-n8n.git
cd TGS-2023035977-Agentic-AI-Automation-with-n8n
```

### 2. Import a workflow into n8n
1. In n8n: **Workflows → Add workflow → ⋯ → Import from File**.
2. Pick a `.json` from the matching `labs/activity*/` folder.
3. Re-select **your own credentials** (OpenAI, Tavily, Gmail) on each node — imported credential IDs won't match yours.
4. **Save**, then toggle **Active / Published**.

### 3. Run the web apps (Activities 3, 4 & 5)
The pages are pure static HTML — just open them, or serve locally:
```bash
cd labs/activity4-rag
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000/index.html
```
- Click the **⚙️ gear** and paste your **chat webhook** production URL.
- In Activity 4, also paste your **upload webhook** URL in the Knowledge Base card, then drag in `MyCompany-HR-SOP.docx` to populate the vector store.
- In Activity 5, populate **both** vector stores: upload `MyCompany-HR-SOP.docx` (HR agent) and `MyCompany-IT-Support-FAQ.docx` (IT agent), then ask an HR or IT question and watch the router dispatch to the right specialist.

> ⚠️ **CORS:** each n8n Webhook node must have **Options → Allowed Origins (CORS) = `*`** so the browser page can call it. All workflow exports in this repo already include this.

For complete, click-by-click setup, see **[LEARNER-GUIDE.md](LEARNER-GUIDE.md)**.
